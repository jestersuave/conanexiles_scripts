*To change your inactive settings, default is set to 3 days removal for my server
one active member saves a clan, otherwise i delete everything u own + ur character and thralls
to change it, open with notepad++ or regular old notepad and press ctrl + H to change all  -3 days   to    -8 days.

*Known Issue - The inactive removal script pulls thrall and pet owner ID's from the game_events table.  It targets ONLY 
event type 89 which is only one of two events logged for pets and thralls, when they die and when they 'return home'.  The return home
is event type 89, this happens after a pet or thrall aggroes to something or someone and then returns back to the position you
originally placed them at.  Currently thrall and pet ownership ID's are stored in the properties table and encoded in ui16LE and cannot
be decoded via sql scripting and can only be done through an outside windows app prebuilt for this table specifically.  This can be done 
through many programming languages, vb,C#,C++,Java etc etc etc.
