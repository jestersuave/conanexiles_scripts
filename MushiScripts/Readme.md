CoalForSilver - This is a simple gather/fetch quest.  Players accept quest, gather 500 
coal and turn it into quest giver for 10 silver.  Quest giver checks to see if 
player is on quest or not, removes quest when completed. Repeatable.

Disgruntled loser - This is for comedic relief, we put in funny responses about admins and
the Loser NPC charges 1 bronze to tell you some 'dirt' about the admins.

EventOrganizer - This is just a simple NPC to place near an Arena entrance/portal entrance
etc etc modify as you see fit.

Server Ambassador is a friendly NPC that you can place anywhere and they will tell you all
about the server you are playing on.  

GlandsForKatana - This is a more in depth multiple item requirement and non repeatable quest.

If you plan on using these Mushi Scripts for your server, Please make sure to edit these 
values in game to match your server name/admin names and other important server related information.
